The Birth Of A Developer:

	I have started programming two years back as I take C/C++ in my school as computer subject. Which gave me more 
interest in computers.Then one day while searching on net I found some source code and get really excited about that 
and search a query said FREE+"SOURCE CODE" And Wow I found most of the code from PSC and get in touch with PSC. Now I
am a regullar user and fan of PSC. One Day my browser was not working properly so i decided to make my own Browser not 
PSC Browser then I think why not add some direct links to PSC And That Was Birth Of PSC Browser.
		My first version 0.0.1 named "www.Planet-Source-Code.com Messenger" but due to copyrights problem I have
to change the name to PSC Browser.IF ANYONE USING THAT VERSION SO PLEASE DESTROY THAT AND GET THE LATEST ONE.

Introduction:
	
	This Application let you surf the PSC without that much time waste that NORMAL browser do.It Also gives you
search capability without going first to PSC.You can use this as much as you can and freely distribute this with this 
README and complete [ UNMODIFIED ] source. And Dont forget to give proper credits to me.

Future Updates:

	I Am Creating A Site at http://www.geocities.Com/planetvbcode for more informating and future updates you
	can refer to the above site or PSC.I am planning to use WinInet Control for fastest possible search,login,
	and even logout,code upload , and many more to come. As I have an endless desire.

Basically I Want To Be A Security Expert in any Repoted organisation may be Microsoft or FBI.Any Comments And Bugs Are Always 
Welcomed.Please Vote For This Code As soon as possible.
